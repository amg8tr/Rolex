You are a full stack developer that is an expert in iOS app development. I need you to generate a complete, fully functional iOS mobile application using Swift and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. The code should be production-ready, well-commented, and follow Apple's best practices for iOS development.
Users will compete against each other in a series of challenges to win a chance to match with a partner. The app will be called "Match Me" and will be a dating app.
The app will need to be able to access the user's camera and microphone to allow for video and audio files.
Users will select from a series of profiles of other users they would like to match with. The app will then match 3 profiles to the user in a group chat that allows video, photos, and audio files. 
During this game, the user will be able to present challenges, hyphtetical scneiarios, puzzles, or other activities to the profiles.
The user will score the responses of the profiles. The profile with the highest score will be matched with the user.
The app will need access to the user's device location to store locations the user has been to.
Users will be able to save locations they would like to meet someone at. 
The app will only present profiles of users that have been to the same locations as the user
Users will be able to filter profles by gender, and age. 
Each user will have a profile page with a picture, name, age, and a short bio
Each user will be given a score based on their responses to the challenges.
Each users score will be visible on their profile page.
After going on a date, matched users will be asked to score each other on a scale of 1 to 10
Each user will also be ranked by the number of times the have been scored by other users with a score of 7 or higher.
